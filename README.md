# Shadow Image Recognition

Given a set of 2D black and white images, the algorithm will rank the images from the given set in terms
of their resemblance to a key image without any preliminary learning.

See the article [the article](doc/article.pdf) for details.

A [src/main.cpp](src/main.cpp) is the source for the tests described in the article. It depends on the [png++](http://www.nongnu.org/pngpp/) library.


The image folder contains the test images used.
