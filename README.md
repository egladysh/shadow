# Shadow Image Recognition

Given a set of 2D black and white images, the algorithm will rank the images from the given set in terms
of their resemblance to a key image without any preliminary learning.

A description can be found [doc/article.pdf](in this article).

A [src/main.cpp](src/main.cpp) is the source for the tests described in the article.


The image folder has the test images used.
